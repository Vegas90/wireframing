# wireframing
Outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. 

## Importance
It clarifies idies and concepts, helps in aiding communication among team members, helps to identify usability issues e.g hierachy issues, saves alot of time and resources e.t.c

# Key Elements of Wireframing
Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

# Types of Wireframes
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined version (low fidelity wireframes with some ummff), often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

# Wireframing tools
There are several wireframing tools available to help designers create effective UI/UX layouts, including Adobe XD, Sketch, Balsamiq, Axure RP, and MockFlow. Each offers unique features such as rapid prototyping, drag-and-drop components, and developer handoff support. However, Figma stands out as the leading tool due to its browser-based platform, which allows real-time collaboration, version control, and easy sharing without the need for downloads. Its intuitive interface, cross-platform compatibility, and strong community support make it the go-to choice for both beginners and professionals in design.

# Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
For example, a designer can create a homepage wireframe in Figma while a developer views and comments on it live, ensuring alignment before the build begins. This immediate communication fosters clarity, speeds up decision-making, and keeps everyone focused on shared goals—making Figma not just a tool for design, but a bridge for team collaboration.

# Wireframing in Practice
During the redesign of a university’s course registration system, the design team used wireframes to outline the user journey for students enrolling in classes. Early versions of the wireframe revealed that the process required too many steps, causing confusion about where to find key features like course prerequisites and time conflicts. Through feedback sessions, students expressed difficulty navigating the interface, highlighting potential usability issues before any development had started. In response, the team revised the layout to display essential course details—such as prerequisites, availability, and time clashes—on a single screen, while adding a filter and search function for easier navigation. These changes, tested and refined through updated wireframes, led to a final product that was significantly more intuitive and efficient. This real-world scenario demonstrates how wireframing helps uncover design flaws early, allowing for thoughtful revisions that improve user experience and ensure a more user-friendly product.
